  <h1>My cause: warm, safe, and dry housing.</h1>
  <p>I spent this past summer working for Appalachia Service Project, a nonprofit with a goal of eradicating 
    substandard housing in Appalachia. ASP is located in 26 counties in Appalachia. Volunteers - high schoolers 
    and adults - come to ASP centers for a week and do construction on homes in substandard condition. Those of us
    who worked for ASP all summer managed the projects. Typical projects
    include insulation, ramps, room additions, roofs, drywall, painting, floor repair, and more. ASP works to make homes
    warmer, safer, and drier. This is a cause I feel strongly about because I saw how having a warm, safe, and dry home
    changed the lives of my homeowners.</p>
