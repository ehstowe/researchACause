  <h1>A cause that is important to me is warm, safe, and dry housing.</h1>
  <p>I spent the summer of 2018
  working for Appalachia Service Project, a nonprofit with a goal of
eradicating substandard housing in central Appalachia. ASP's mission is to make
homes <b> warmer, safer, and drier. </b> I saw how having a warm, safe, and dry home changed the lives
of my homeowners. When homes are in substandard condition, they are a hazard
to families, and cost more to upkeep and heat. </p>

    <p><a href="housing.csv">Here</a> is a link to data taken from the
      American Housing Survey, a survey conducted by the US Census. The AHC
      is responsible for defining standards of home "adequacy." This data pertains
      to the housing adequacy of homes in the rural United
      States. The data shows that there are many homes that are not warm,
      safe, and dry. </p>

      <p>These are photographs of a project I managed this summer. Volunteers added safe stairs and a handrail
      after a young girl living here fell off the tall porch and had to get stitches on her nose. They also
      added insulation under the home to help decrease heating and cooling expenses.<p>
